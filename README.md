# Fake News Detection

Our group is developing a Neural Network solution to detect first fake news when inputted an article and then classifying as what type of fake news it is.

## Step 1: Fake News Detection

In this first step, we run five different types of NNs and choose the best one (based on the evaluation metrics) to continue with Step 2. The `merge.csv` file from the Data Source Folder is used as our dataset. It is splitted into the following ratio: 80-10-10 (training-testing-validation).
